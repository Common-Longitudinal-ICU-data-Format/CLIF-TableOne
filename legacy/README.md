# Legacy Scripts

This directory contains legacy scripts from the original Table One generation feature.

## Files

- **generate_table_one.sh** - macOS setup script for original Table One generation
- **generate_table_one.bat** - Windows setup script for original Table One generation
- **generate_clif_report_card.py** - Original CLI report card script (superseded by current app.py and run_analysis.py)

## Note

These scripts are preserved for reference. The current CLIF 2.1 Validation & Summarization Tool (app.py and run_analysis.py) provides enhanced functionality and should be used instead.

For current usage, see the main README.md in the repository root.
